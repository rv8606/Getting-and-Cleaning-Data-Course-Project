Peer reviewed submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project of Coursera

*This repository has been created for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.*
It is a peer reviewed submission.

It contains the files instructions and source code used to get and clean the data contained in the dataset **"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"**
Original dataset from:
> Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.  
> Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory  
> DITEN - UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova.  
> Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

##Files
- **CodeBook.md** : code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
- **run_analysis.R**: the required R script that does the following: 
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- **CourseraDataCleaningSubmission.txt**: export of the independant tidy dataset resulting of the above manipulations.
